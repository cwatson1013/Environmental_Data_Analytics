## LESSON OBJECTIVES
1. Discuss data challenges in the environmental field
2. Evaluate how data management fits into the pipeline of data analysis
3. Acquire data through database searches, R packages, and webpage scraping

## CONTEMPORARY DATA CHALLENGES

Environmental fields are experiencing massive changes related to data. Many new challenges exist today, including: 

* Big data: volume, variety, frequency
* Open data
* Long-term records
* Interconnected networks
* Verifying accuracy and integrity

## DATA MANAGEMENT

Adapted from the [DataOne data management primer](https://www.dataone.org/sites/all/documents/DataONE_BP_Primer_020212.pdf) and the [University of Alabama Library guide on data management](http://www.lib.ua.edu/wiki/sura/index.php/A_Step-By-Step_Guide_to_Data_Management)

1. Choose and assemble data management toolbox
2. Create (and revisit) your data management plan
  + Volume and type of data
  + File and folder structures/formats
  + Roles and responsibilities of personnel
  + Version control
  + Access
  + Preservation
3. Collect data
4. [Quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC)](https://www.dataone.org/best-practices/ensure-basic-quality-control)
5. Describe and document data
6. Store and preserve data in a repository

## ACCESSING DATA 
### Database searches
**Various disciplines**

[re3data](https://www.re3data.org/)

[DataOne](https://search.dataone.org/data)

[Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)

[EDI Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp)

[NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/data/neon-data-portal)

[LTER](https://portal.lternet.edu/nis/home.jsp)

**Water**

[CUAHSI HydroClient](http://data.cuahsi.org/)

[CUAHSI HydroShare](https://www.hydroshare.org/search/)

**Spatial Data**

[ArcGIS](http://hub.arcgis.com/)

Search one or more of these databases to find a dataset that interests you. What did you find? 

> ANSWER: 

### R Packages
* NHANES: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
* TidyCensus: U.S. Census data
* FedData: Geospatial data from federal sources
* dataRetrieval: USGS and EPA water quality, streamflow, and metadata
* LAGOSNE: Multiscaled geospatial and temporal data for U.S. lakes

### Data scraping
Sometimes, there may be data that we can access online but are not available in downloadable formats. Data scraping is a technique that allows us to convert unstructured data (e.g., those presented in a webpage) into a structured format (e.g., a csv file). 

Methods for scraping data (from [Analytics Vidhya data scraping guide](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/beginners-guide-on-web-scraping-in-r-using-rvest-with-hands-on-knowledge/)): 

* Manual copy-paste
* API (Application Programing Interfacing) (retrieve data from standard code; data must be in prescribed format) interface and retrieve data
* DOM parsing (Digital Object Model)
*mgrast - metagenomic research that people put online

We will be scraping today using DOM parsing. First, we need to install a tool on our web browser to be able to call the web text we need. The tool is called a Selector Gadget, which for Chrome can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=en). 

Now that our selector gadget is in operation, we can start the data scraping process with the `rvest` package. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("rvest")
library(rvest)

# Specify website to be scraped
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_by_length"  #tell R that we have a new variable named URL and to add the website link

# Reading the HTML code from the website
webpage <- read_html(url) #telling R to read in the html with read_html

# Grab specific components of the website
Name <- webpage %>% html_nodes("td:nth-child(2)") %>% html_text()  #grabbing the river name column; td:nth-child(2) is the path that was found when using the selector gadget; html_nodes = pointing tp specific part of the website
Length.km <- webpage %>% html_nodes("td:nth-child(3)") %>% html_text()
DrainageArea.km2 <- webpage %>% html_nodes("td:nth-child(5)") %>% html_text()
Discharge.m3s <- webpage %>% html_nodes("td:nth-child(6)") %>% html_text()
Outflow <- webpage %>% html_nodes("td:nth-child(7)") %>% html_text()

# Coerce into a data frame, ensure consistent lengths
riverdata <- data_frame(Name = Name[6:188], #telling it which rows it wants from Name becuase some of them you don't wnat
                        Length.km = Length.km[2:184], 
                        DrainageArea.km2 = DrainageArea.km2[2:184], 
                        Discharge.m3s = Discharge.m3s[2:184], 
                        Outflow = Outflow) #outflow is already 183 in length, which is the length we want

# Remove unnecessary text from within cells
riverdata$Name <- str_replace(riverdata$Name, "\\[.*\\]", "") #str_replace means string replace; removed anything with square brackets and what was inside them; leave open quotes to say that it stays empty; \\ tells R to remove any spaces
riverdata$Name <- str_replace(riverdata$Name, "\n", "")


riverdata$Length.km <- str_replace(riverdata$Length.km, "\\*", "")
riverdata$Length.km <- str_replace(riverdata$Length.km, "\\(.*\\)", "") #remove anything in () 
riverdata$Length.km <- str_replace(riverdata$Length.km, "\\[.*\\]", "")

riverdata$DrainageArea.km2 <- str_replace(riverdata$DrainageArea.km2, " \\(.*\\)", "") #includes a space in the code so that it will remove the ones with spaces as well
riverdata$DrainageArea.km2 <- str_replace(riverdata$DrainageArea.km2, "\\(.*\\)", "")
riverdata$DrainageArea.km2 <- str_replace(riverdata$DrainageArea.km2, " \\[.*\\]", "")

riverdata$Discharge.m3s <- str_replace(riverdata$Discharge.m3s, " \\(.*\\)", "")
riverdata$Discharge.m3s <- str_replace(riverdata$Discharge.m3s, "\\[.*\\]", "")

# Turn numeric values from character to numeric; R didn't read river length in as a number, it read it in as a character; turing number columns into numeric from characters ends up putting in NAs as well
riverdata$Length.km <- as.numeric( sub(",", "", riverdata$Length.km)) #replacing the comma with nothing
riverdata$DrainageArea.km2 <- as.numeric( sub(",", "", riverdata$DrainageArea.km2))
riverdata$Discharge.m3s <- as.numeric( sub(",", "", riverdata$Discharge.m3s))
  
# Plot the relationships
ggplot(riverdata, aes(x = Length.km, y = Discharge.m3s, fill = DrainageArea.km2)) + 
  geom_label(data = subset(riverdata, Name == "Rio Grande" | Name == "PurÃºs"), 
            aes(label = Name), alpha = 0.8, nudge_x = 100, nudge_y = 0.15) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 3, alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "inferno", begin = 0.2, end = 0.9, direction = -1) +
  theme_classic() + 
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(x = "Length (km)", y = expression("Discharge (m"^"3"*" s"^"-1"*")"), 
       fill = expression("Drainage Area (km"^"2"*")")) +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.key.width = unit(1, "cm"))
```
